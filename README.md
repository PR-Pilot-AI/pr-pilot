# PR Pilot üöÄ

PR Pilot is a GitHub bot designed to autonomously understand and execute tasks based on commands in GitHub comments. It leverages the power of Django, Python, Docker, and Kubernetes to provide a seamless experience for managing GitHub projects. For more information, visit our [documentation](https://docs.pr-pilot.ai) and the official website at [www.pr-pilot.ai](https://www.pr-pilot.ai).

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

PR Pilot operates on a robust architecture that includes:

- A registered [GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps) to interact with GitHub repositories.
- A Django application deployed to receive GitHub webhooks, processing commands found in issue comments and pull requests.
- An nginx server for serving static files efficiently.
- Jobs triggered by webhooks to execute `/pilot` commands within the GitHub environment.
- A Kubernetes cluster that orchestrates the deployment of the Django app, nginx server, and job execution.
