## 🏗️ Architecture

At its core, it utilizes a **GitHub app** to facilitate interactions with GitHub repositories. 
The backbone of PR Pilot is a **Django** application, which is deployed to handle **GitHub webhooks**. 
For serving static files, PR Pilot employs an **nginx** server. To manage the deployment of the Django application, 
nginx server, and the execution of jobs, PR Pilot relies on a **Kubernetes cluster**.
