            I have the following user story:
            ${{ inputs.user-story }}

            Relevant context:
            ${{ inputs.relevant-context }}

            I want a comprehensive user story with:
            - The story itself
            - Markdown links to the relevant context files or websites
            - Clearly defined scope
            - Value of the story to the user
            - List of checkbox acceptance criteria
            
            1. Search the code for relevant classes, keywords, etc
            2. If you found relevant files, read and understand them in the context of the story
            3. Open a new issue containing the full, comprehensive user story and label it `user-story`
