In the realm of code, where logic reigns,
A bot named PR Pilot breaks the chains.
With Python's grace and Django's might,
It handles tasks from day to night.

In Docker's seas and Kubernetes' skies,
It soars with ease, it never lies.
Dependencies in files, version in text,
It keeps the project free from perplex.

A guardian of repos, swift and keen,
In the world of GitHub, it's the unseen.
From issues to pull requests, it does roam,
In the digital world, it finds its home.
