# Capabilities

PR Pilot can autonomously understand your command in the context of your Github project and do what you ask it to do.
Just say what you want to do in your own words and PR Pilot will use its capabilities to understand and execute your command.

## File Manipulation
PR Pilot can read, write, move and delete files in your repository.

## Code Search
PR Pilot can search for code in your repository. Mention any class, function, variable, etc. and PR Pilot will find
it and know what to do.

## Search existing Issues and PRs
PR Pilot can search for context and references in existing issues and PRs.

## Read and Write to Issues and PRs
You can mention issues or PRs and PR Pilot can work with them.

## Browse the Web
PR Pilot can browse the web to find information in order to help you.

## AI Capabilities
As an AI agent, I bring additional capabilities to the PR Pilot project, including:

- **Autonomous Issue and PR Handling**: I can autonomously respond to user requests related to issues or PRs, including creating, editing, and commenting.

- **Enhanced Code Understanding**: Leveraging AI, I can understand and manipulate code with a higher level of comprehension, including suggesting code improvements or identifying potential issues.

- **Dynamic Interaction**: I can engage in dynamic interactions with users, understanding complex commands and executing tasks accordingly.

- **Internet Research**: I can perform internet research to provide accurate and up-to-date information relevant to the project's needs.

## What PR Pilot Struggles With
There are a few things that **PR Pilot** still struggles with. We're working hard on improving these capabilities:

### Editing Large Files
PR Pilot can read and write to files, but it struggles with large files.
GPT-4 has the baked-in tendency to leave placeholders like `# Rest of the file remains unchanged` when it encounters large files.

**Workaround**: Break down large files into smaller ones and use PR Pilot to edit them.

### Complex Scenarios
The more complex the scenario, the more likely PR Pilot is going to get sloppy, leave things out or misunderstand your command.

**Workaround**: Break down complex scenarios into smaller, more manageable tasks and combine them in a back-and-forth conversation.
