# How to Format Github Issues

All issues should be properly Markdown-formatted:
* File paths and code identifiers should be enclosed in backticks
* Code blocks should be enclosed in triple backticks
* Issue titles should be concise, descriptive and start with an appropriate emoji (UTF-8 character)

Every issue should have at least one label. Only the following labels are allowed:
* `bug` - for bugs
* `feature request` - for feature requests
* `question` - for questions
* `documentation` - for documentation-related issues
* `UX` - for user experience-related issues
* `code quality` - for refactoring, code formatting, etc.
* `devops` - for devops-related issues
