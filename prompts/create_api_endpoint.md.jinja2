We want to add a new API endpoint for listing tasks.

1. Read all API-relevant files in `api/` to understand the current API structure.
2. Add a new serializer for the endpoint
3. Add a new view for the endpoint that uses the serializer
4. Add a new URL configuration for the endpoint
5. Add a new test for the endpoint
