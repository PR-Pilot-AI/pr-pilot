Our goal is to add badges to the README.md file to make it more visually appealing and informative.

Here is how you can determine which badges would be most useful for this project:

## Step 1: Gather project information
1. List the `.` directory and read the `README.md` file
2. Identify the project's main language and framework
3. List the `.gihub/workflows` directory

## Step 2: Choose badges
Based on the information gathered, choose the badges that would be most useful for this project:
- Build status
- Any unit tests that are run as part of CI/CD or Github Actions
- Code coverage
- Language or framework-specific badges (e.g. Python, Django, React)
- Code quality (e.g. linting, formatting)
- License

## Step 3: Add badges to README.md
1. Find the best place in the README to put the badges (usually at the top)
2. Generate the badges with valid values taken from the information gathered earlier
3. Add the badges to the README.md file
