We ran our unit tests, here's the output:

---
{{ sh('cat tox_output.log') }}
---

If the tests are green, do nothing. Otherwise:
1. Identify the parts of the code that are not working.
2. Read the relevant test files AND implementation files to get a better understanding of the problem.
3. Pretend like you're a senior engineer and draft a comment that you would leave on the PR with the failing tests
{% if env('PR_NUMBER') %}
4. Comment on PR #{{ env('PR_NUMBER') }}. Try to sound like a real human.
