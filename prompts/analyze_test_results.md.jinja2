We ran our unit tests, here's the output:

---
{{ sh('cat tox_output.log') }}
---

If the tests are green, do nothing. Otherwise:
1. Read the PR #{{ env('PR_NUMBER') }}
2. Understand which code changes caused the tests to fail
3. Comment on the PR

Your comment should:
- Not have a headline
- Not be spammy, keep it concise
- Start by listing which tests failed, including Markdown links to the files
- If applicable, provide code snippets that show the changes that caused the tests to fail
