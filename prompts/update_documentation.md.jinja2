Some files that are part of the task engine were updated:

---
{{ sh('cat changed_files.txt') }}
---

The task engine is documented in `docs/code/task_processing.md`.

Do the following step-by-step:
1. Read the documentation file and the files that were changed
2. Identify gaps in the documentation
3. Update the documentation to reflect the changes made to the task engine

When writing the documentation, ensure that:
- Mermaid diagrams are used to illustrate the relationships between components
- Code snippets are included to clarify complex processes
- Files are references with Markdown links for easy navigation
