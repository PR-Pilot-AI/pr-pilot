name: Create a new PR Pilot Integration
prompt: |
  We are adding a Sentry integration to PR Pilot. Users will be able to enter their API key in the dashboard
  and PR Pilot will use its agent tools to search the Sentry API for issues and events.
  
  An integration is composed of the following:
  - A dashboard page with:
    - An HTML template in `dashboard/templates/integrations/`
    - A view controller in `dashboard/views/integrations.py`
  - A Django model in `accounts/models.py` to store credentials
  - A set of langchain agent tools in `agents/integration_tools/`

steps:
  - name: Create Django model
    prompt: Add the Django model for storing the Sentry API key
  - name: Update dashboard template
    prompt: The template currently contains dummy text. Replace it with a form to enter the API key.
  - name: Update view controller
    prompt: Add a view controller to handle the form submission and store the API key using the Django model.
  - name: Create agent tools

      1. Read `engine/agents/integration_tools/slack_tools.py` to understand how agent tools work
      2. Implement Sentry agent tools in `engine/agents/integration_tools/sentry_tools.py`
      3. Write unit tests for the new tools in `engine/agents/tests/test_sentry_tools.py`
      4. Register the tools in `engine/agents/integration_tools/__index__.py`
