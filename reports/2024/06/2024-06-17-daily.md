# Daily Report for 2024-06-17

Good morning! Here's a quick summary of what happened yesterday in the PR Pilot project.

## Highlights
- We had a productive day with several new issues and PRs created.
- Documentation and CLI improvements are the main focus areas.

## Issues
- **Linear Issues**:
  1. Document the PR Pilot CLI - We need to create comprehensive documentation for the PR Pilot CLI, including usage instructions, examples, and troubleshooting tips.
  2. CLI Should show link to dashboard if task fails - If a task fails and `--quiet` is enabled, the CLI should still display a link to the dashboard for faster debugging.
  3. Document Integrations - Integrations are the newest concept in PR Pilot, where users can connect it to other services. At the moment, two integrations exist: Slack and Linear. [This PR](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot/pull/132) shows all code related to integrations. What's needed is a dedicated page in the [user documentation](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot/tree/main/docs). Each integration should have its own page.
